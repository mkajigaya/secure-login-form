# **Project Summary & Reflection** 

**Name:** Megumi Kajigaya


## **A Brief Overview**
- Tested a new Login feature of a secure application.
- Testing included functional, UI, non-functional, and cross-browser testing. 
- The feature was tested manually using a Windows laptop (Home 11), across Chrome and Firefox browsers.
- One positive test scenario was automated using Playwright and TypeScript.


## **Challenges** 
I challenged myself to be thorough with testing as much as possible while being mindful about the time spent. I worked in short focused time blocks, avoided dwelling on an area for too long, and aimed to finish each part within the recommended timeframe. I will continue polishing my skills so I can deliver high-quality projects quickly. 


## **Estimated Time Spent**
**Part 1:** 1 hour and 30 minutes

**Part 2:** 2 hours

**Part 3:** 1 hour and 30 minutes

**Part 4:** 45 minutes

**Part 5:** 45 minutes

**Part 6:** 30 minutes


## **Further Recommendations For Testing**
- As only a Window laptop was used for this testing project, it is recommended that different types of devices, inluding iMac and tablets, as well as a browswer like Safari should be included in the future testing for more comprehensive coverage.
- Screen reader testing should be included in the future as it was out of the scope of this project.
